        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Bennett Van Soelen. I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 25th, 2000. I grew up on the
            north side of Indy in the City of Carmel.
            Fun fact: Carmel, Indiana has the most roundabouts out of every city in the world. We currently have 125
            roundabouts and you typically don't have to stop whenever you drive through the city.
        </p>
        <h2>What I like</h2>
        <p>
            Some of my favorite things to do include playing basketball, spending time with friends, playing videogames,
            and going to concerts.
            Unfortunately, due to covid, I haven't been able to go to a concert since February of 2020. While this is a
            first world problem I still would like to be in a large crowd again.
            Despite not being able to go to concerts, I still have been keeping up with the things I enjoy.
            Last semester, our group was involved in a friendly four team basketball league that played twice a week.
            This gave everyone the opportunity to get outside and active after sitting on zoom calls all day.
            The league definitely helped improve morale among our friends.
            I also have spent a lot of time playing videogames. One of my favorite games is Stardew Valley.
            In the Valley you can farm, fish, mine, make friends, and much more. I have no limit to the amount of time
            that I spend on that game.
            When I'm not doing the things that I enjoy, I'm probably completing schoolwork or looking for a job.
