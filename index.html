        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Bennett Van Soelen. I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on February 25th, 2000. I grew up on the north side of Indy in the City of Carmel.
            Fun fact: Carmel, Indiana has the most roundabouts out of every city in the world. We currently have 125 roundabouts and you typically don't have to stop whenever you drive through the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my favorite things to do include playing basketball, spending time with friends, playing videogames, and going to concerts.
